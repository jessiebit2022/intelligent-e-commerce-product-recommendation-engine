## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB/PostgreSQL

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up the ML model:
   ```bash
   cd ml-model
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up the API:
   ```bash
   cd api
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the ML model service:
   ```bash
   cd ml-model
   python main.py
   ```

2. Start the API server:
   ```bash
   cd api
   npm start
   ```

3. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/recommendations/:userId` - Get personalized recommendations
- `POST /api/user-interaction` - Record user interactions
- `GET /api/products` - Retrieve product catalog
- `POST /api/feedback` - Submit recommendation feedback

## Machine Learning Model

The recommendation engine uses collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques:

- **Collaborative Filtering:** Analyzes user-item interactions to find similar users
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends items similar to user's past preferences
- **Hybrid Approach:** Combines both methods for improved accuracy
